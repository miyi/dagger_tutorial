      <p>
        To follow this tutorial you need a basic understanding of html, css, and javascript. 
        Every dagger functionality is accessible through the dagger defined
        attributes and configuration. Let's see exactly how it work and how to
        use it with a few simple tutorials. Our tutorials will first introduce
        how a few specific directives work, then work our way to the bigger
        picture where we create reusable components and put it all together into
        a functional web.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">State management</div>
      <p>
        Having interactive features on a single webpage is the defining
        characteristics of the modern web. Html elements must react to
        constantly changing data or complex user interactions. Behind it all is
        a state management system that keeps track of all the moving pieces.
        Dagger makes it easy through lifecycle directives. Let's see what that
        looks like in action by creating a task card.
      </p>
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene1.loadingData()">
      <div class="grid-container" height="360px">
        <demo_html +loading="scene1.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene1.loadingBrowser(title, assignee, details)"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="section">
      <p @raw>
        We used the +loading directive to create 3 scope variables: title,
        assignee, and details. The element where +loading is defined acts as a
        boundary for the scope variable data, which can be manipulated anywhere
        within the boundary. In our example, ${title} resolves into "create
        card". Dagger recognizes anything inside the ${...} markup as native
        javascript code; it sees title as a javascript variable, which points to
        the string value defined in the +loading directive.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">
        Manipulating the scope variables with directives
      </div>
      <p>
        We can manipulate the scope variable from the browser by adding more
        interactive elements to the task card. First let's create 2 boolean
        scope variables called complete and collpase. Then we add a button that
        switches between the boolean states of these variables. When the
        complete status is true, let's turn the card green, and when collapse is
        true let's shorten the card to just show the title.
      </p>
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene2.loadingData()">
      <div class="grid-container" height="380px">
        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene2.loadingBrowser(
          dollar_class,
          complete,
          complete_btn_click,
          collapse_btn_click,
          title,
          assignee,
          details,
          collapse)"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        To accomplish the visual effects we wrote a CSS class "complete" that
        turns the card green, and another CSS class "collapse" that shortens the
        card and adds transition, what we want to show is dagger can activate
        desired effects through the use of dagger directives.
      </p>
      <div class="sub-title">Event directives</div>
      <p>
        First let's talk about the event directive +click. In general, event
        directives work by attaching to the host element an eventListener that
        listens to the event type following the + sign. There is a dagger event
        directive for every UI event type. For example the +keydown directive
        will trigger when the user presses something on the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 2 instances of +click directives in our example. The +click
        directive in the complete button evaluates the scope variable
        "complete", and toggles its value on every click. The +click directive
        in the title works in the same way. Clicking on the div with class
        "title" toggles the "collapse" scope variable. Try changing the +click
        directives to see what happens.
      </p>
      <div class="sub-title">Control directives</div>
      <p>
        Not only do we need to toggle the scope variables, but we also need to
        achieve the visual effects depending on those scope values. We can
        achieve that with the use of the $class control directive. Control
        directives differentiates from event directives in that control
        directives generally watches for changes in the scope variables in its
        input. Control directives all start with the symbol $, and can recompute
        results that whenever their assigned scope variables in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this card example, we used the $class directive to add or remove the
        corresponding class names depending on the state of the "complete" and
        "collapse" scope variables. $class accepts any javascript function that
        resolves into any one of 3 types, object, array, and string. For our
        purpose we chose the object. When assigned an object, $class evaluates
        the value of the key. If evaluated to be true, the key name is then
        added to the class attribute of the host. Because the computation
        process of $class included scope variables "complete" and "collapse",
        the directive now watches these variables for changes to update the
        class names when needed.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">resource management with dagger/configs</div>
      <p>
        Now that the card component is getting more complex, writing all the
        javascript logics inside the html file is starting to feel convoluted.
        Let's first separate out the javascript from the html into their
        respective files card.js and card.html.
      </p>
    </div>
    <demo_container>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <demo_js +loading="scene2.loadingSeparatedJs()"></demo_js>
        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingSeparatedHtml()"></demo_html>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            We offloaded +loading and +click functions to card.js. Dagger
            directives will execute any javascript without extra apis. Simply
            pass the relevant scope variables into your function as parameters
            to manipulate them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we need to link card.js and card.html together. Exposing all
            javascript code as globally will run into naming conflicts in larger
            projects, so dagger manages a heirarchy tree for it's resources
            through dagger/configs. We call it namespace, and we will discuss it
            in greater details in the next tutorial. For now, think of it as
            importing another file. Dagger/configs can auto-identify the content
            type, and now the resources are scoped within file where
            dagger/configs is defined.
          </p>

        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingConfigsHtml()"></demo_html>

        <p>
          You made it through the first tutorial &#127881; Now you know how to
          make a simple card component with dagger directives and
          dagger/configs. Next we'll show you how to make more complex
          components with more directives and abstractions.
