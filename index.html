      <div class="chapter-title">Welcome to dagger.js</div>
      <p>
        dagger.js is a directive based web framework that is natively supported
        by the browser. This means that there are no apis and no compiling,
        which makes for a clean and intuitive way to design the modern web.
        Every dagger functionality is accessible through the dagger defined
        attributes and configuration. Let's see exactly how it work and how to
        use it with a few simple tutorials. Our tutorials will first introduce
        how a few specific directives work, then work our way to the bigger
        picture where we create reusable components and put it all together into
        a functional web.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">State management</div>
      <p>
        Having interactive features on a single webpage is the defining
        characteristics of the modern web. Html elements must react to
        constantly changing data or complex user interactions. Behind it all is
        a state management system that keeps track of all the moving pieces.
        Dagger makes it easy through lifecycle directives. Let's see what that
        looks like in action by creating a task card.
      </p>
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene1.loadingData()">
      <div class="grid-container" height="360px">
        <demo_html +loading="scene1.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene1.loadingBrowser(title, assignee, details)"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="section">
      <p @raw>
        The +loading directive created 3 scope variables: title, assignee, and
        details. The element tags act as natural scopes for the variables, which
        can be readily access and manipulated anywere within the scope with the
        ${} markup. the onloading directive accepts any object, or functions
        that resolve into an object. play around with scope variable values to
        see how it affects the output.
      </p>
      <div class="section-title">
        Manipulating the scope variables with directives
      </div>
      <p>
        We can manipulate the scope variable from the browser by adding more
        interactive elements to the task card. First let's create 2 boolean
        scope variables called complete and collpase. Then we add a button that
        switches between the boolean states of these variables. When the
        complete status is true, let's turn the card green, and when collapse is
        true let's shorten the card to just show the title.
      </p>
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene2.loadingData()">
      <div class="grid-container" height="380px">
        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene2.loadingBrowser(
          dollar_class,
          complete,
          complete_btn_click,
          collapse_btn_click,
          title,
          assignee,
          details,
          collapse)"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        To accomplish the visual effects we wrote a CSS class "complete" that
        turns the card green, and another CSS class "collapse" that shortens the
        card and adds transition, what we want to show is dagger can activate
        desired effects through the use of dagger directives.
      </p>
      <div class="sub-title">Event directives</div>
      <p>
        First let's talk about the event directive +click. In general, event
        directives work by attaching an EventListener to the host, listens to
        the event type following the + sign, and executes the statement when the
        event is triggered. There is a dagger event directive for every UI event
        type. For example the +keydown directive should trigger the assigned
        statement when the user presses something on the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 2 instances of +click directive in our task card example. The
        +click directive in the complete button evaluates the scope variable
        "complete", and toggles the variable value on every click. The +click
        directive in the title works in the same way. Clicking on the div with
        class "title" toggles the "collapse" scope variable. Try changing the
        +click directives to see what happens.
      </p>
      <div class="sub-title">Control directives</div>
      <p>
        Not only do we need to toggle the scope variables, but we also need to
        achieve the visual effects depending on their values. We can achieve
        that with the use of the $class control directive. Control directives
        differentiates from event directives in that control directives
        generally watches for changes in the scope variables in its input.
        Control directives all start with the symbol $, and can recompute
        results that whenever their assigned scope variables in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this card example, we used the $class directive in particular to add
        or remove the corresponding class names depending on the state of the
        "complete" and "collapse" scope variables. $class accepts any javascript
        function that resolves into 3 types, objects, arrays, and strings. For
        our purpose we used the object. When assigned an object $class evaluates
        the value of the key. If evaluated to be true, the key name is added to
        the class attribute of the host. Because the computation process of
        $class included scope variables "complete" and "collapse", this
        directive now watches for their changes to update the class names when
        needed.
